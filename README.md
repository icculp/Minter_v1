Side project to build a simple web app to mint an image as an NFT - progress is slow with all my other obligations.

The goal is to hash an image with IPFS and store the hash in the metadata of the smart contract; the NFT should be tradeable on Opensea, so their proxy account needs to be whitelisted.

My next goal is to write another smart contract to create a time-locked wallet to be able to send NFT's to. 

Right now the web interface is just a basic react boilerplate but eventually you can see the progress here at
